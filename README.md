# Car Price Analysis and Prediction

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of car price data, including various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, outlier detection, and price prediction. The data covers different car attributes, such as brand, model, fuel type, mileage, horsepower, and more.

## Features and Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating car price distributions, feature correlations, and identifying trends.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying outliers using Z-Score and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends with plots.
- **Price Prediction**: Using machine learning models to predict car prices based on available features.

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots).
   - Identifying feature relationships and trends.
3. **Outlier Detection**: 
   - Z-Score method.
   - IQR method.
4. **Price Prediction**: 
   - Machine Learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).
   - Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`
  You can install them using:
